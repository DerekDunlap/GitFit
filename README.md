## Website description:
Personally, I have never came across a Fitness related website that met my personal expectations in terms of what I feel a Fitness website should provide its users. Thus, leading me to develop my own envisionment of those expectations. GitFit is a Fitness site that allows users to have full access to everything the site has to offer without pressuring users into subscribing to a monthly payment plan. But Why? Simply because GitFit was built without any greeding subscription.

This means that users are free to Create an account that will then be properly encrypted using into GitFit's database, utilizing hashes, allowing users to return to their personal account at anytime. Additionally, users have the ability to view all of our "Recommened Workouts" upon login and add any exercise to their personal "Workout Plan". Users can begin a workout session at anytime with the mere click of a button. Whenever you wish to delete your account you can do so at the bottom of each page and all of your information with be deleted from GitFit's database.
